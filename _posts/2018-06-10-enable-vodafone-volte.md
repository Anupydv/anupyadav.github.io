If you have a VoLTE-capable phone and still not getting *VoLTE* services on it. Just follow this concise guide to activate *VoLTE* on your device.<br>

In February 2018, *Vodafone* launched *VoLTE* services in metropolitans and select cities in India. The enhanced service is available for free of cost but you need to have a VoLTE-capable device. If you have either Prepaid or Postpaid connections, this guide will work for both of them. Follow these simple steps for activation (please note, these steps are for Android users only, sorry *Apple* fans.)

<h3>What You Will Get?</h3>
Notice the *VoLTE* icon on the status bar next to the 4G signal strength.

<h2>So Let's Get Started</h2>
<h3>From Within Your Phone Settings:</h3>

__Step 1__: Go to Settings.<br>
__Step 2__: Tap on Mobile networks.<br>
__Step 3__: Look for *VoLTE* option and turn on *VoLTE* Mode.

<h3>Hard Reset & Wipe:</h3>
Make sure your device is charged more than 60%.<br>

**Disclaimer:** This step would erase the data present on your phone, I would strongly recommend making a backup of your personal data before proceeding. 

__Step 1__: Turn off your device.<br>
__Step 2__: Press and hold *Power* and *Volume Down* Button<br>
__NOTE:__ Other common button combinations are<br>
* Nexus devices - Volume Up, Volume Down, and Power
* Samsung devices - Volume Up, Home, and Power
* Moto devices - Volume Down and Power
* Other devices generally use Volume Down and Power. Some devices with physical user interfaces may use the Power and Home buttons.<br>

__Step 3__: When you are in *Recovery Menu*, look for *wipe data/factory reset*, use the Volume keys to navigate and Power Key to select.<br>
__Step 4__: Similarly, look for *wipe cache partition*, after performing both wipes, Reboot the phone. <br>

**Note:** If the *VoLTE* icon in the status bar is still not visible then you probably *Vodafone* need to enable *VoLTE* for you from their backend, for that follow these steps:

<h3>Get VoLTE Enabled From Backend by Vodafone:</h3>
