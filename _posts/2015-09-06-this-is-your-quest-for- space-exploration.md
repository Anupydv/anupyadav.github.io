__"The important thing is to not stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvellous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day."__ - Albert Einstein

Once in our lifetime, there comes a time when you gaze into the sky on that starry night and think. Think deeply. Think about the possibilities of the existence of life.

Why do we exist? Why do we see the life around us?
<br> __<center>Our universe was one of the universes where the conditions were just right for life to form.</center>__

So there might be a chance. And you might have pondered and imagined all the possibilities that you can explore. You might have thought, what is out there millions of light years away? Far enough that even our imagination would sometimes feel incapacitated, despite having limitless strength of our powerful cognitive ability.

Even Google wouldn’t be able to quench your thirst for attaining the answers to the ultimate questions about life and everything. Go ahead and try to Google:<br> __<center>What is the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything?</center>__ <br>You would be perplexed by what it is going to say. That’s because you are asking a supercomputer to sum up all the things that are present around us and in space. And what we humans thrive to know. We are looking at the deepest secrets of our universe and almost everything we have come across in life at a point of singularity.

Now let’s put things into a wider perspective, ready? Below is an interactive app. Use the slider to explore the smallest to the largest things possible in our cosmic horizon of space and time continuum.

If you want to get amazed about our Universe. I would recommend you to watch this awesome video, titled __"The Known Universe"__. It takes viewers from the Himalayas through our atmosphere and the inky black of space to the afterglow of the Big Bang. Every star, planet, and quasar seen in the film is possible because of the world’s most complete four-dimensional map of our Universe. This Digital Universe Atlas is maintained and updated by astrophysicists at the American Museum of Natural History. This new film, created by the Museum, is part of an exhibition, Visions of the Cosmos: From the Milky Ocean to an Evolving Universe, at the Rubin Museum of Art in Manhattan through May 2010.
