Hi, I'm <strong>Anup Yadav</strong> — a data-driven professional with strong roots in <strong>supply chain operations</strong>. Currently working as an <strong>Assistant Manager at Zomato (Hyperpure)</strong>, I help optimize processes across dark store logistics and fresh inventory management. My daily work revolves around solving real-world problems using <strong>data, analysis, and operational experience</strong>.

<span class="fa fa-chart-bar about-icon"></span>
With a passion for data and business strategy, I build insightful dashboards and automate workflows using tools like <strong>SQL, Excel, Power BI, Python</strong>, and <strong>Google Sheets Apps Script</strong>. I'm fascinated by the way structured data can help uncover inefficiencies and guide better decisions.

I hold a Bachelor's degree and have built my career in the operations domain — blending field experience with data storytelling. My unique mix of ground-level insight and data logic lets me contribute meaningfully across tech and ops teams.

As I transition into a full-time <strong>Data Analyst</strong> role, I’m building a hands-on portfolio of projects focused on supply chain analytics, warehousing KPIs, inventory performance, and root cause analysis. You can explore some of those projects in the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> section.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading about business strategy, data science, and behavioral economics. Some of my recent favorites include “Atomic Habits” and “The Lean Startup”.

I'm also someone who believes in balance — you’ll often find me cycling early mornings or planning travel routes that blend mountains, food, and exploration.
